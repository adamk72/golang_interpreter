# Notes

I purchased [_Writing An Interpreter In Go_][1] with the intent of re-learning the basics of coding. I'd spent so many years in the abstracted realm of UI and so many more years doing program management, I thought this would be a useful mind-expanding exercise.

At the time of this writing, I hadn't written a lexer or parser in over 20 years and never written a REPL, compiler, or virtual machine. Also, I'd never written a lick of Go code either (not that it was much of a barrier compared to writing something like this in pure C).

What I share here are my notes about the project in an attempt to get things clear in my head. They probably won't make sense unless you have access to the books (there are actually two projects; one for an interpreter and the other for a compiler).
